takes research grade images from inaturalist and puts them on your screen for you to ID. Enter the names of species, then press enter.
For studying/learning to ID stuff from a bunch of different images.

uses python libraries requests, tkinter and PIL. i think you gotta download those.

right now it is functional but it is not perfect. i plan on working on this more when i get the chance. this was born out of an incredible amount of boredom
and an intense determination to not do my schoolwork, and those vices will likely be what maintains it.

no styling yet. also still some wonky stuff that happens. one image remains on your device and is not deleted after the program is closed. and there is also
little error handling. also letting the user input whatever they want and then going to that website may be kind dangerous. as well as deleting files
sort of based on user input. Something to know about and likely change in the future. but i am no cyber security expert. if you find a way to delete system32
on your own computer thats on you lol.


any questions/whatever can be directed at ehlke2@wisc.edu
