#### Windows and mac anti-virus might get angry at these files.

On windows there will be a pop-up saying "windows protected your PC". You can just click more info>Run Anyways.

On mac this is what you can do:

    In the Finder on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.

    Don’t use Launchpad to do this. Launchpad doesn’t allow you to access the shortcut menu.

    Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.

    Click Open.

    The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.

## Other stuff

takes research grade images from inaturalist and puts them on your screen for you to ID. Enter the names of species, then press enter. For studying/learning to ID stuff 
from a bunch of different images.

The "List of exam 1 plants" is a .zip archive of .TXT json files about 80 plants that I used to study for exam 1. If you wanna mess around with them, just download it, 
extract the archive and on after clicking the "start studying!" button in the program, you can click the "Import from file button".

You can make study sets. All they are is a list of species names (e.g Viola sororia) followed by details about (maybe the common name, family, etc. Whatever you want to 
remember about it.) Once you make a list of species and extra information about them, you can save the file, then import it when studying to load all of those species 
and whatever information you wrote about them.

right now it is functional but it is not perfect. i plan on working on this more when i get the chance. this was born out of an incredible amount of boredom and an 
intense determination to not do my schoolwork, and those vices will likely be what maintains it.

any questions/whatever/ERRORS (please send me errors so i can fix them, they'll pop up in a log.txt file!) can be directed at ehlke2@wisc.edu
