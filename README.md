List of exam 1 plants for importing and studying---
https://bigwordsscareme.github.io/inatbot/data/plants/exam1plants.zip

takes research grade images from inaturalist and puts them on your screen for you to ID. Enter the names of species, then press enter. For studying/learning to ID stuff from a bunch of different images.

The txt files are JSON's of all the plants for exam 1 of botany 401 (and a few extras). Press the import file button to use them. I plan on making
a way to create JSON's like these easily and from the application in the future.

uses python libraries requests, tkinter, ttkthemes, PIL. i think you gotta download those.

right now it is functional but it is not perfect. i plan on working on this more when i get the chance. this was born out of an incredible amount of boredom and an intense determination to not do my schoolwork, and those vices will likely be what maintains it.

any questions/whatever/ERRORS (please send me errors so i can fix them) can be directed at ehlke2@wisc.edu
