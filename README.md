<sub>List of exam 1 plants for importing and studying--- https://bigwordsscareme.github.io/inatbot/data/plants/exam1plants.zip </sub>

## Other stuff

takes research grade images from inaturalist and puts them on your screen for you to ID. Enter the names of species, then press enter. For studying/learning to ID stuff 
from a bunch of different images.

The "List of exam 1 plants" is a .zip archive of .TXT json files about 80 plants that I used to study for exam 1. If you wanna mess around with them, just download it, 
extract the archive and on after clicking the "start studying!" button in the program, you can click the "Import from file button".

You can make study sets. All they are is a list of species names (e.g Viola sororia) followed by details about (maybe the common name, family, etc. Whatever you want to 
remember about it.) Once you make a list of species and extra information about them, you can save the file, then import it when studying to load all of those species 
and whatever information you wrote about them.

right now it is functional but it is not perfect. i plan on working on this more when i get the chance. this was born out of an incredible amount of boredom and an 
intense determination to not do my schoolwork, and those vices will likely be what maintains it.

any questions/whatever/ERRORS (please send me errors so i can fix them, they'll pop up in a log.txt file!) can be directed at ehlke2@wisc.edu
